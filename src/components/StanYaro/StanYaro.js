          For 8 years i lead records and statistics of sales where acquired analytical thinking, the ability to work
          calmly with a large amount of information and tasks. The ability to sort and distribute tasks has become the
          basis for successful work. And, of course, i'm get into the habit of meeting the deadlines because of the

        <h2>Managing, Retail network</h2>
        <p style={style ? lightStyle : darkStyle}>
          Working on a network, i began to communicate with people much more, acquiring new communication skills. Then i
          consolidate my ability to solve problems, because there were many more of them on the network. The ability to
          find solutions by any means without fear of new actions. When i became a Senior operator, i'm acquired a new
          mentoring skill. I've trained the operator from scratch until my replacement, which gave me experience and
          understanding of the complexity of the training process. And teamwork, where i learned to divide work by
          complexity and help to resolve problems to covering each other’s backs.

        <h2>IT Development, Self Education</h2>
        <p style={style ? lightStyle : darkStyle}>
          Starting a new career growth in a new industry, i broke my usual way of life for a new goal. I got out of my
          comfort zone, which brought me a lot of stress, but added more fuel to my engine to continue learning new
          skills and abilities. This is a new limitless world that allows you to constantly develop your skills and
          become a better person than you were yesterday.
